# Knowledge Engineering Project

This project aimed to realise a supervised model for 3 problems involving thyroid hormones:

- 1ยบ To assess whether a person has a particular thyroid problem according to their values.
- 2ยบ Trying to guess their gender according to their values.
- 3ยบ Try to guess their sex according to their values.

A dataset with approximately 8000 patient entries was used to train and test the model.

## Notes

- The project was realised in python using the sklearn library.
- The project was carried out using a Jupyter notebook, so all you have to do to run the project is run the cells.
- Alongside the work is the final report in Portuguese on analysing the problems with the models made.
- The final evaluation of the project was 19.5/20.
